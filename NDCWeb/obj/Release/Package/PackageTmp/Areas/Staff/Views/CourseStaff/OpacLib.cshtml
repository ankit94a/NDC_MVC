The automated software OPAC enables touch screen issue of all books, theses and journals available in the library. The wi-fi enabled environment allows extensive use of internet for research. The online database can be accessed from all terminals in the Computer Centre, IAG rooms and outside campus also. Information on availability of books can be ascertained without going to library. The library catalogue is uploaded on NDC website and can be searched through it.</p>
